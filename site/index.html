<H2 id="no-dtd">No DTD-Based Validation</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>Validator.nu does not check for XML 1.0 validity constraints.
	That is, DTD validation is not performed.</P>
	<LI><P>Validator.nu does not perform the duties of a “validating
	SGML parser” as defined in ISO 8879. In fact, this service does
	<EM>not have any SGML functionality at all</EM>. In particular, the
	HTML 4.01 support uses the HTML5 parser with some additional error
	conditions.</P>
</UL>
<H2 id="usage">Basic Usage</H2>
<p>Validator.nu has two facets: <a href='http://validator.nu/'>generic</a> (complex UI) and <a href='http://html5.validator.nu/'>(X)HTML5</a> (simple UI).</p>
<P>Enter the URL (<CODE>http</CODE>, <CODE>https</CODE> or <code>data</code> IRI to be
exact) of the document you want to validate in the field labeled
“Document” and submit the form. That’s all it takes in most
cases. 
</P>
<P>In the <a href='http://html5.validator.nu/'>(X)HTML5 facet</a>, the parser and the schema will be chosen
based on the HTTP <CODE>Content-Type</CODE> of the document. In the
<a href='http://validator.nu/'>generic facet</a>, the parser will be chosen based on the HTTP
<CODE>Content-Type</CODE> and a preset schema will be chosen based on
the root namespace (for XML) or the doctype (for <CODE>text/html</CODE>).</P>
<H2 id="alt-input">Alternative Modes of Input</H2>
<P>For simplicity, the HTML5 facet only shows UI for validation by URL. Validation by text area 
and by file upload are available in the <a href='http://validator.nu/'>generic facet</a>.</P>
<p>Here are bookmarklets:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="javascript:void(location.href='http://html5.validator.nu/?doc='+encodeURIComponent(location.href))">Validate URL (generic)</a></li>

<H2 id="config">Configurability</H2>
<DL>
	<DT>Schemas</DT>
	<DD><P>When the field for schemas is left empty, the validator will try to
	choose a schema on its own. If you are not happy with the guessed
	preset, you can specify a schema either by selecting a preset or by
	entering a space-separated list of schema URLs (<CODE>http</CODE>,
	<CODE>https</CODE> or <code>data</code> IRIs). In addition to actual schemas, you may use 
	certain special URLs to invoke <A HREF="#checkers">checkers
	that seem like special schemas but aren’t actually implemented as
	schemas</A>.</P></DD>
	
	<DT>Parser</DT>
	<DD><P>If the automatic choice of parser does not work for you, you can
	choose the parser manually. The choice of parser affects the HTTP
	<CODE>Accept</CODE> request header that is sent.</P></DD>
	
	<DT id="content-type">Be lax about HTTP Content-Type</DT>
	<DD><P>When the lax option is set, <CODE>text/html</CODE>, <CODE>text/xsl</CODE>
	and <CODE>text/plain</CODE> are allowed as XML content types and
	<CODE>text/plain</CODE> is allowed as an HTML content type and, if
	the URL ends with <CODE>.rnc</CODE>, as a Compact Syntax content
	type. Also, in the lax mode the US-ASCII default for <CODE>text/*</CODE>
	XML types is not enforced.</P>
	<P>Normally, schemas using the RELAX NG XML syntax, Schematron schemas
	and the XML documents to be validated are expected to be served
	using an XML content type. Schemas using the RELAX NG Compact Syntax
	are expected to be served using <CODE>application/relax-ng-compact-syntax</CODE>
	content type. (The unregistered <CODE>application/vnd.relax-ng.rnc</CODE>
	content type is also understood.) HTML documents are expected to be
	served as <CODE>text/html</CODE>.</P></DD>
	
	<dt>Show Image Report</dt>
	<dd><p>When the “Show Image Report” checkbox is set, a report concerning the textual 
	alternatives of <code>img</code> elements in the XHTML namespace is shown for accessibility 
	review.</p></dd>
	
	<DT>Show Source</DT>
	<DD><P>You may check the “Show Source” checkbox to show the decoded
	source of the document being checked. Please note that the source
	may not be shown in its entirety if the parser encounters a fatal
	error. Moreover, the show source feature shows the decoded Unicode
	source. Erroneous byte sequences in the original source and
	characters that would render the validator output as non-conforming
	(e.g. U+0000) are not represented faithfully.</P></DD>

<H2 id="faq">FAQ</H2>
<H3>My server gives the HTML5 validator a 406 status. What’s up?</H3>
<P>Your server cannot properly deal with an <CODE>Accept</CODE>
header that does not have <CODE>*/*</CODE> in it. Chances are that
you are using Apache 1.3, PHP and MultiViews together. MultiViews
thinks the type of your page is <CODE>application/x-httpd-php</CODE>,
which isn’t in the <CODE>Accept</CODE> header. Apache 2 does not
have this problem.</P>
<H3 id="no-badge">Can I get a “Valid HTML5” badge?</H3>
<P>No, Validator.nu does not give badges.</P>
<P>I have observed that once people are given badges they start to
feel entitled to the badges and become hostile if the validation
service is changed so that some documents that previously were
proclaimed valid no longer are. I do not want to deliberately incite
an opposition to bug fixes. I <EM>know</EM> some of the schemas are
not as tight as the corresponding spec prose. If I make them tighter,
consider it a bug fix. Moreover, the HTML 5 spec is still changing,
so the schema will change as well. Finally, I may (and even intend
to) change the namespace associations of preset schemas in the
future.</P>
<P>In addition to the problem with changing the validator after
badges have been awarded, badges <A HREF="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/html/validation.html#icon">don’t
provide value to the readers</A> of validated pages. Validation is a
tool for you as a page <EM>author</EM>—not something your <EM>readers</EM>
need to verify. However, if you are writing about Web authoring and
want to refer others to Validator.nu, please, by all means feel free
to link to Validator.nu.</P>
<H3>Java? Eww. Why didn’t you write it in Python or Ruby?</H3>
<P>By the time Ruby on Rails hit everyone’s radar, this project was
already underway. However, Ruby would still have been a bad choice
had I considered it seriously earlier. Ruby lacks a solid Unicode
infrastructure. <A HREF="http://hsivonen.iki.fi/php-utf8/">I’ve
already been in a situation</A> when I had to stop writing app code
and spend time writing the <EM>very basics</EM> Unicode
infrastructure. I don’t want to be in that situation again. <A HREF="http://intertwingly.net/blog/2007/12/25/Two-Steps-Forward">Ruby
lacks solid XML infrastructure</A> as well.</P>
<P>I chose Java over Python for three reasons: SAX, Jing and more
experience with Java. Apart from Java feeling like a more secure
choice because I had more experience with it, the choice between Java
and Python also comes down to infrastructure. Having a platform-wide
unified way for plugging together XML tools is extremely important
when what you are doing entails plugging together XML tools
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>Java is in a unique position when it comes to XML tool
infrastructure. Java has a lot of XML-related libraries available and
they pretty much all plug into the same interface. Not only is there
a platform-wide XML API, it is also happens to be one of the most
complete and correct of the XML APIs around. From the point of view
of RELAX NG, Java being the language Jing is written in is an
extremely important consideration. Jing is a seriously good piece of
software. Moreover, Java is the native language of the extensibility
interface for RELAX NG datatype libraries.</P>
<P>While I’m on a soap box, I should mention that ICU4J is a
seriously good piece of software, too, and having Java’s notion of
Unicode frozen as UTF-16 from to dawn of time until eternity is very
important considering the stability of infrastructure. It is a
horribly bad idea that the meaning of Python programs change (due to
datatypes changing underneath) depending on <A HREF="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0261/">how
the interpreter was compiled</A>. <A HREF="http://unicode.org/notes/tn12/tn12-1.html">Unicode
is optimized for 16-bit units.</A> The stability of sticking to
UTF-16 in RAM everywhere outweighs the theoretical purity of UTF-32
in RAM. (On disk and network, use UTF-8, of course.)</P>
<P>I do want to make the validator functionality available to
applications that are not written in Java, though. This is why
Validator.nu has a <A HREF="#api">Web service interface</A> that can
be used either with the instance running at validator.nu or with a
your private instance running at localhost. I encourage you to write
a wrapper library for the Web service in your favorite programming
language.</P>
<H3>What’s wrong with DTDs?</H3>
<P>I think DTDs are bad in four ways:</P>
<OL>
	<LI><P>DTDs pollute the document with schema-specific syntax. Since
	the document itself declares the rules, the question on answered by
	DTD validation is not the question that should be asked. DTD
	validation aswers the question “Does this document conform to the
	rules it declares itself?” The interesting question is “Does
	this document conform to these rules?” when the person who asks
	the question chooses the rules the question is about.</P>
	<LI><P>DTDs mix a validation mechanism, an inclusion mechanism and
	an infoset augmentation mechanism. The inclusion mechanism is mainly
	used for character entities, which solve (but only if the DTD is
	processed and processing it is not required!) an input problem by
	burdening the recipient instead of keeping input matters between the
	editing software and the document author.</P>
	<LI><P>DTDs aren’t particularly expressive.</P>
	<LI><P>DTDs don’t support Namespaces in XML.</P>
</OL>
<P>I hope providing an online validation service for RELAX NG removes
the excuse that DTDs are needed for online validators.</P>
<h3>Validation has a clear and precise meaning. Can’t you kids read ISO 8879?</h3>
<P>“Validation” and “validator” in the name and the user
	interface of the service refer to the ISO/IEC FDIS 19757-2
	definition of “validator” (which performs validation), to the
	Schematron “validation” function (which is performed by a
	validator), and to the HTML 5 definition of “validator”.</P>
<H2 id="ideas">Known Issues and Ideas for Future Development</H2>
<P id="issues">Schemas for XHTML 1.0 are used for HTML 4.01, because XHTML
		1.0 is supposed to be a reformulation of HTML 4.01 in XML. However,
		there are some subtle spec bugs introduced in the reformulation.
		For this reason, some errors for HTML 4.01 are wrong. For example,
		XHTML 1.0 (in the DTD) forbids the <CODE>name</CODE> attribute on
		the <CODE>form</CODE> element, although it is allowed in HTML 4.01.</P>

<H2 id='details'>Feature Details for Custom Schemas</H2>
<UL>
	<LI><P>ID/IDREF/IDREFS checking in RELAX NG is enabled for the
	benefit of those who use their own schemas and expect this feature
	to work. However, the preset schemas do not use RELAX NG
	ID/IDREF/IDREFS features, because the checking isn’t precise
	enough (cannot require that the referent is of a certain type) and
	using these features places really annoying restrictions on the
	schemas.</P>
	<LI><P>Comments are not exposed to the validation layer and,
	therefore, cannot be matched in Schematron.</P>
	<LI><P>The document is validated independently (but concurrently)
	against each schema. The Schematron validators do not see IDness
	assignments from the RELAX NG validators.</P>
	<LI><P>Embedded Schematron is not supported.</P>
	<LI><P><CODE>xml:id</CODE> processing is performed. Also, the
	attribute <CODE>id</CODE> in no namespace is given IDness unless the

This will download, build and run the system at
<CODE>http://localhost:8888/</CODE>. For other options, please run
<KBD>python build/build.py --help</KBD> instead. Please note that the
dependencies are big. The script will spend time downloading stuff.
The script requires Python, Subversion and JDK 5 or later (JDK 6 and Hardy’s OpenJDK work). (Tested on Mac OS X and Ubuntu. On Windows, the build completes but the app crashes on startup.) <strong>Note:</strong> The script wants to see a Sun-compatible <code>jar</code> executable. Debian <code>fastjar</code> will not work.</P>
<H3>Deployment</H3>
<P>The above example starts a standalone HTTP server with debug
messages printed to the console. To use <A HREF="http://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/ajp/ajpv13a.html">AJP13</A>
instead, use <KBD>--ajp=on</KBD>. A <A HREF="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/docs/">log4j</A>
configuration for deployment can be given using the <KBD>--log4j=</KBD>
option. There is a sample file in
<CODE>validator/log4j-deployment-sample.properties</CODE>. The
directory <CODE>extras/</CODE> is searched for additional jars for
the classpath. For example, if you configure log4j to send email, you
should put the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javamail/">Java
Mail API</A> and <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/javabeans/jaf/">JavaBeans
Activation Framework</A> jars in <CODE>extras/</CODE>.</P>
<H2 id="ack">Acknowledgments</H2>
<P>I would like to thank the Mozilla Foundation and the Mozilla
Corporation for funding this project.</P>
<P>I would like to thank James Clark for writing Jing and for
championing RELAX NG and XML. I would also like to thank everyone who
tested the development builds, the writers of test cases and everyone
who has developed library code and schemas that the service uses.</P>
<P>The XHTML 1.0 schemas were originally written by James Clark and
have been improved by Petr N&aacute;levka.</P>
<P><A HREF="http://fantasai.inkedblade.net/">fantasai</A> designed
the (X)HTML5 schema framework, wrote the (X)HTML5 Core schemas and
helped along the way when I added features.</P>
<p>JavaScript bits, the favicon and a lot of bug reports were contributed by Simon Pieters.</p>
<P>The schemas for RELAX NG and XSLT were written by James Clark.</P>
<P>The principal author of the schema for DocBook is Norman Walsh.</P>
<P>The SVG schemas come from the W3C.</P>
<P>The MathML schema was written by Yutaka Furubayashi.</P>
<P>Test cases written by <A HREF="http://syntax.whattf.org/relaxng/tests/html5core/">fantasai</A>,
<A HREF="http://webforms2.testsuite.org/">Anne van Kesteren</A> and
<A HREF="http://schneegans.de/sv/test-cases/">Christoph Schneegans</A>
were very useful in developing this service.</P>
<P>This product includes software developed by The Apache Software
Foundation (http://www.apache.org/).</P>
<P>This product uses The SAXON XSLT Processor from Michael Kay.</P>

<H2 id="tos">Terms of service</H2>
<P><CODE>#include &quot;common-sense.h&quot;<BR>#include
&quot;disclaimer.h&quot;</CODE></P>
<P>If you do not accept these terms or the Privacy Policy below, do
not use the service.</P>
<P>This service is provided in the hope that it is useful. Neither
Henri Sivonen nor anyone else has any obligation to provide this
service to you. The service or any part thereof may be discontinued
at any time without notice. There is absolutely no warranty. There is
no guarantee of a level of service. If you need a guaranteed level of
service, you should probably run your own instance of the software.</P>
<P>Please use the service reasonably. If you call it from your own
blog, that’s cool. If you need a validator as a part of a massively
traffic-generating blog hosting service, please run your own
instance.</P>
<H2 id="privacy">Privacy policy</H2>
<P>When you access the validation service, data about the access is
logged for the purpose of understanding the use of the service,
<EM>identifying popular resources for retrieval to local storage</EM>
and acting on abuse. 
</P>
<P>The HTTP request/response pair between your user agent and the
service is logged in the “combined” format (without identd
check). The logged data includes the network address of the remote
host from which the request came, the HTTP authentication name (if
for whatever reason supplied; not requested by the service), the date
and time of the request, the first line of the request including the
HTTP version, the path part of the URL and <EM>the query string
containing the validator arguments</EM>, the HTTP “<CODE>Referer</CODE>”
header (where you came from) and HTTP “<CODE>User-Agent</CODE>”
header (the name and version of your browser).</p>
<p>Additionally, the URLs
of the HTTP requests made by the validator are logged. Some internal error
conditions may also be logged. When an internal error condition is logged, the
log entry may include data entered by you or pertaining to the
resources your request caused the validator to process. Finally, (X)HTML5 
validation errors are logged for documents that are retrieved from the Web 
(i.e. for documents that are world-readable anyway).</P>
<P>The logs are readable by me (Henri Sivonen) and, technically, by
the administrators of the hosting provider. I have no intent of
sharing raw log entries with others (except with law enforcement
officials if necessary). However, I reserve the right to publish
aggregate statistics derived from the logs.</P>
