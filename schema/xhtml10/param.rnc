# http://relaxed.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/relaxed/schema/xhtml/1.0/
# has the name attribute made optional and has a comment saying:
# "modified - bugfix - attribute name is required just in transitional"
# ...but it seems like the bug here is actually in the XHTML 1.0 Strict
# DTD, because the HTML 4.01 DTD does make the name attribute required here,
# and the XHTML 1.1 DTD does also; so it seems likely that the XHTML 1.0
# difference was just a copy/paste error - sideshowbarker
