The MathML schema files found here are modified versions of the files at:

  http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml3-restricted/

For details about those, see:

Excerpt:

  mathml3-restricted is a version of the schema with all element and
  attribute names introduced at MathML3 removed (by applying the XSLT
  stylesheet included in the directory). This makes it usable as a schema
  for MathMl2, but benefitting from the stricter attribute typing specified
  in the MathML3 specifcation. It differs from MathML2 in some respects
  notably on the exact lists of attributes allowed on each element, as it
  follows MathML3 usage, however the similarity to MathML3 helps maintance,
  and may help users migrating from MathML2 to MathML3.

The modifications made to those files were made in order to facilitate
validation of HTML documents containing MathML. The modifications are all
flagged with comments added to the files.

The modifications were done using the following steps:

  1. Download the files from http://www.w3.org/Math/RelaxNG/mathml3-restricted/
  2. Rename the files.
  3. Apply the patch-vnu file in this same directory.

Those steps are automated in the Makefile in this same directory.
